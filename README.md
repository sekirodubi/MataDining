# MataDining

Enemy &amp; asset dumper for Elden Ring maps

# Usage

Get Visual Studio and build the solution.

Drag & Drop either `.msb.dcx` or the `MapStudio` folder into the `MataDining.exe`. 

Notepad should open two files with the dumped data in .csv folders. (The files are stored in your Temp folder with the `MataDining_` prefix).
